A comprehensive system for detecting depression and mental health disorders using multiple data modalities: Quantitative EEG (QEEG), EEG-EDF signals, and Audio recordings. This project implements advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to provide accurate classification and diagnosis support.

## üìä Project Overview

This depression detection platform consists of three primary modules, each utilizing different data modalities:

1. **üî¢ Quantitative EEG Channel Data** - Classification of 12 mental disorders from EEG features
2. **üìà EEG-EDF Based Depression Detection** - Binary classification of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) vs. Healthy
3. **üé§ Audio Based Depression Detection** - Identification of depression markers from speech patterns

## üìã Module Details
